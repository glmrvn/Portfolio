        <h2>What led you into design?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">Design has always been part of my life. I’ve always liked making things. When I was young, I remember watching my father fix electronics. To me, it looked like a miracle. I watched with curiosity and tried to make things myself. It felt almost like an obsession. I was always trying to understand how things work, why they work, and what they are made for. I spent many evenings reading magazines and books about technology.</p>
        <p class="case-text">As a teenager, I learned programming and constantly tried to learn something new after school. I quickly understood a simple rule: when you create something new, how it works is very important. But how it looks is no less important. That’s when I became interested in product design and interface creation.</p>
        <p class="case-text">I got into Photoshop to create phone skins, websites, and concept interfaces. It was a passion for improving everything around me that you could see and touch. Over time, this passion became my first job in 2010.</p>

        <h2>What does a typical day look like?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">I am an early riser. In summer, my day usually starts around 6 a.m. Every morning, I make black tea, water my plants, take a shower, read the news, and check my to-do list. On my way to work, I like listening to podcasts or interviews with inspiring people.</p>
        <p class="case-text">I start my workday by reviewing tasks. I collaborate closely with product and engineering teams and usually have several meetings to discuss processes and planning. For the rest of the time, I love diving into pixels and focused design work. A good day for me is a day when I’ve made something better.</p>
        <p class="case-text">After work, I spend my evenings at home reading or watching something.</p>

        <h2>What’s your workstation setup?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">At home, I work on an iMac 5K (2017) and a MacBook Air M2. At work, I use a MacBook Pro 15” (2019) and a Dell P2715Q.</p>

        <h2>Where do you go to get inspired?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">I can find inspiration everywhere around me. It comes from materials, architecture, and interiors. I especially love nature. I feel lucky to be able to notice beauty in simple things.</p>
        <p class="case-text">I enjoy traveling to different cities and countries. I often go for walks, observing nature or architecture, and paying attention to things I haven’t seen before. I like thinking about how people solve problems and design solutions for everyday routines. I’m a big fan of Swedish and Japanese interior design and architecture.</p>
        <p class="case-text">I also love Dribbble, Pinterest, and Instagram, where I try to find inspiration every day. I enjoy taking time to explore great products from tech companies, startups, and agencies.</p>

        <h2>What pieces of work are you most proud of?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">That’s not an easy question. I’ve always been part of great teams. I’m proud of the fact that products I’ve designed are used by people every day.</p>
        <p class="case-text">I also enjoy self-initiated projects. In 2018, I created an <a href="https://creativemarket.com/ikke-design/2800800-Stockholm-Premium-Icons-Pack" target="_blank">icon set called Stockholm</a>. I’m very happy and proud that many people use it in their projects.</p>
        <img src="../img/cases/stockholm-case.png" alt="">
        <p class="case-text">One of my favorite projects is the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/760927481606931799/Appearance" target="_blank">Appearance Figma Plugin</a>. I developed it to help designers create dark themes in seconds. This solution is used by thousands of designers around the world.</p>
        <img src="../img/cases/appearance-case.gif" alt="">
        <p class="case-text">Another project I’m proud of is my apartment. I worked a lot on its design and concept, and I did almost all the renovation work myself. I’m very happy with how cozy it feels now.</p>

        <h2>What design challenges do you face at your company?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">Maps is a complex application. We work on many everyday scenarios, such as search and navigation. That’s why we need to keep the quality bar high. For me, the main challenge is designing a product that solves the needs of very different users within one application. We have a large team working on many types of problems.</p>

        <h2>Any advice for ambitious designers?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">Enjoy what you do every day. A product designer’s career is often closer to engineering than to art — it’s important to remember that. Iterate until you’re sure the solution feels right.</p>
        <p class="case-text">Stay curious and flexible in your thinking. Learn new things, step outside your comfort zone, and pay attention to what truly excites you. Do the work you love.</p>

        <h2>What product have you recently seen that made you think this is great design?</h2>
        <p class="case-text">The Taccia lamp. It’s a floor lamp designed by Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni in Italy in 1962. For me, it’s a great example of timeless design.</p>

        <h2>What music do you listen to whilst designing?</h2>
