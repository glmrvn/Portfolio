            <h1><span class="black-text">Yandex Maps and Navigator for CarPlay and Android Auto</h1>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_1.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">This project is unique and the hardest in my experience. I worked with two apps (Maps and Navigator) and two platforms at the same time.  Also, It was the most difficult release because we integrated a paywall in the navigation app.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="case-text">What I learned from this project</p>
            <p class="black-text">— Test your first mocks in the right environment. We used the figma prototype on an iPad and a car in  to test user flow and user experience.  It was very helpful.  We then tested and debug Dev builds every day for regular commute.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_9_1.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Try to use your interface in real life, it will help to make it better. For example, we put the speed limit to the top left corner of the dashboard because city navigation use more right turns.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_2.jpg" alt="">
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_3.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Apple and Google platforms have so many limitations. Android Auto platform was unstable, which updates could break layout and logic.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_4.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Icons and text should be visible on the screen. A contrast ratio of 7:1 or higher is preferred. Carplay has resource issues if the scale factor of the car device is different from the scale factor of the phone.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_5.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— You could work only with the platform layout. It could be a pain with errors and custom elements.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_6.jpg" alt="">
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_7.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Research is a good idea because user flow in the car is very different. It helps with text sizes and controls.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_8_1.jpg" alt="">
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_8_2.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Always think about safety. We have decided to restrict the use of phone when your are driving.</p>
