            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_1.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">Yandex Maps and Navigator are one of the leading Geo applications in Russia. Millions of people using our apps every day. Automotive platforms like CarPlay and Android Auto are becoming more popular everyday. Not surprisingly, It has been one of the biggest feature requests on the AppStore and Google Play.</p>
            <p class="black-text">The main challenge of this project was to create apps on two platforms with our great features in limited by platform environment. As a result our Apps at the top of stores, and we did four applications published in one day.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="case-text">What I learned from this project</p>
            <p class="black-text">— If you are creating something for cars, you need the right environment. We were testing our first mocks in the car. Actually, it was half of car. We used the figma prototype on an iPad and a car in  to test user flow and user experience.  It was helpful, because it was fast dive in the car expirience.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_9_1.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Try to use your interface in real life, it will help to make it better. For example, we put the speed limit to the top left corner of the dashboard because city navigation use more right turns.</p>

            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_3.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Get ready to start your work from again. Apple and Google platforms have so many limitations. Android Auto platform was unstable, which updates could break layout and logic.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_4.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Icons and text should be visible on the screen. A contrast ratio of 7:1 or higher is preferred. Carplay has resource issues if the scale factor of the car device is different from the scale factor of the phone.</p>
            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_5.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— You could work only with the platform layout. It could be a pain with errors and custom elements.</p>

            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_7.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Research is a good idea because user flow in the car is very different. It helps with text sizes and controls.</p>

            <img src="../img/carplay/carplay_case_8_2.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="black-text">— Always think about safety. After some tests we decided to restrict phone use when your drive.</p>
