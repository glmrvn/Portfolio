            <h1><span class="black-text">My places. How we redesigned my places and created a shared lists.</h1>
            <p class="black-text">This project is about one of the favorite features of our users - my saved places. We started this project in 2020 during the difficult times of COVID. Our team consisted of me, the product manager, analysts and developers. Finally, we can say that this project is completed, but let's see how it was.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_1-min.jpg" alt="">

            </br>
            <p class="question">Context</p>
            <p class="black-text">The Maps app is used by millions of people every day. People love to save their favorite places. And they have many reasons - some people want to create a list to plan a visit, some people save the places they know so that they can find that place in the interface the fastest. In fact, people could start their flow in one application and continue in another Yandex application.</p>
            <p class="black-text">For example, you found a restaurant on the Yandex Maps website and then saved this place. Now you can easily find this restaurant in the Yandex Maps mobile applications and call or book a table. Then, after a couple of hours, you could use Yandex Navigator and go to this restaurant. The next day, you can write a review or rebook, and so on. Saved places and created lists help you get things done faster.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_2-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">We had a lot of user requests to improve saved lists and decided to update this part of our product. This project is about the quality of our product and a user-friendly feature.</p>

            <p class="question">Problem</p>
            <p class="black-text">The main goal of this project was to set up a new data format for our updated My Places. Since one of the feature requirements was list sharing, that means we have to create a great privacy experience. Our users should share the list with comments without any problems.</p>
            <p class="black-text">Another big problem was the multi-platform launch. Because web, iOS and Android must be implemented at the same time. For a product designer, this means many small iterations. Also, the design of My Places was outdated and had UI and UX issues.</p>

            <p class="question">Process. Research and Setup</p>
            <p class="black-text">We're looking into how people use bookmarks these days. How many lists and places they have, we saw in our analytics. No brainer, people love to save places, but they don't use a lot of lists. They usually only use one list, which they have by default. There are two ways to save space in our product. First, by toponym or organization card. The second of the long tap menu that you can use in any scenario.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_3-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">We dived into app store user reviews and user requests from our product. People use bookmarks and want to share them. This has been one of the biggest user requests and our competitor already has this feature.</p>
            <p class="black-text">We also received feedback from our users about the ability to leave comments, because if you share something, it is very important to tell someone why this place is on your list. In most cases, this will be something like a recommendation or a brief conclusion about the place.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_4-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">The product manager and I agreed on the data format of the new lists. I dived in the mocks, the manager started to setting up the backend team.</p>

            <p class="question">Process. My places</p>
            <p class="black-text">This is what My places looked like when I started working on them. We had a search and filter, home/work snippets and your lists.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_5-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">As you can see, most of these modules have problems. For example, it's hard to decide how to edit a saved home or work. This screen has a universal editing mode that you might have seen in older versions of iOS.</p>
            <p class="black-text">First, I tried to use one design pattern for all list items and remove "Edit Mode". My solutions after a few iterations are very simple. Now all list items will have a button ••• with options. There are various options for listings and locations on the menu. This is a good template for using the menu context menu.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_6-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">In my solutions you can follow (save) the list from another user. But this lists have a difference. You can see that your lists and the lists to which you are subscribed have a different left side. Your lists have the same icon as on the map, and signed lists have photos. I decided to show the difference between these types of lists, because if you use the same design, it will be difficult to recognize which one belongs to you.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_7-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">The new search now uses the same list item component and can show you places and a list that we haven't shown before.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_8-min.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="question">Process. Creating list</p>
            <p class="black-text">First of all, let's discuss how to manage your lists. Previously, you could create lists, arrange them, and show or hide them on the map.</p>
            <p class="black-text">For all our users, we have added several new features. Users can now select an icon for lists and add a description. The selected icon will be used as a list marker on the map.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_9-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">For the color icon selection screen, I used our rubric icons that we used in maps (over 100 icons). For iOS, we wanted to add emoji support, but it's difficult because it has to work on all platforms. By the way, the emoji was already supported by the hack, it works if you use the emoji of the first letter of the list name.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_10-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">Finally, how it looks on the map. I used zoom dependency and showed two icon sizes. As you get closer, you will see the name on the saved location. I supported a dark and light theme where I used some rules for a perfect display on the map.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_11-min.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="question">Process. Lists</p>
            <p class="black-text">For places in lists, I use the same principle as with snippets on the main screen of lists. I have added ••• an options button and added a comment (notes) module for each saved location. Tapping on an input will open an input screen with a keyboard.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_12-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">The header also has •••  and buttons for "Share" and "Add Place". For the public list, I use the same design, but additionally show the author and a button to save or subscribe to this list.</p>
            <p class="black-text">A large description can contain a lot of text, which means that the listings can be used as collections of places from influencers or publishers.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_13-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">For a list with organizations or place names that have images, we show a gallery. It shows the first images from places in the list. We use this module in our organizations and toponyms.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_14-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">Finally we got the list screen. You can collapse the list and see all places on the map.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_15-min.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="question">Result</p>
            <p class="black-text">Two years passed from the beginning of the project to the final decision in production. We took small steps to integrate feature by feature to get a redesign. The big challenge for our team was to develop this solution on three platforms at the same time. We took our first step on the Desktop and Touch platform because it's the fastest way.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_16-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">Experiments with the new design have been successful and user feedback has been excellent. People love how it looks on a map and people are starting to use lists. I believe that sharing will be a useful feature in our product.</p>
            <img src="../img/myplaces/myplaces_img_17-min.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="black-text">The final result is here. Lots of hard work and complex development. This is just the beginning of our journey, stay tuned for new major releases.</p>
